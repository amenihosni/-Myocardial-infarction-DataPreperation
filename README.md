💓 Predicting Complications from Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) 💓

🌟 Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a predictive model that helps medical professionals identify patients who are at risk of developing complications after a heart attack. By predicting these risks early, doctors can take steps to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.

🔍 How the Model Works:


📊 Data Cleaning: 
We started by cleaning a dataset of 1,700 records with 124 features (or columns), which included information about patients’ medical history and test results.

🔧 Data Processing:

Missing Values: 
🧩 Some parts of the data were missing. We used a method called mean imputation to fill in the gaps.
Feature Selection: 🔍 We selected 10 important features that are likely to have a strong impact on predicting complications.
⚖️ Feature Scaling: We scaled the features using a technique called Standardization to make sure the values are comparable and to improve the performance of our model.



🚀 Next Steps

Now that we’ve prepared the data, the next steps involve:

Building and testing different machine learning models 🤖 (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others).


Finding the best model to predict complications with the highest accuracy.


Applying this model to real-world data to help doctors and hospitals.

🎨 Key Highlights:

1,700 medical records analyzed


124 features reduced to 10 key features


Focus on early prediction of heart complications
